# Shopify-free-gift-modification-bug
<p>Recently I found a bug on shopify store.</p>
<h2>Customers always get more free gift than sellers want on shopify store.</h2>
<h3>Reason:</h3>
<p>The cart of shopify basicly stored on customer's browser, which means it could be modified. Normally, it doesn't really matter a lot. Because if you add more products to your cart, you pay more. But what if there is a free gift? What if this store is pretty big and they are using a ERP system to do the delivery? Customers will get free gift because of that. </p>
<p>In the past I thought this won't be possible, who could be so boring to do something like this? Cheat for free gift? Well, recently I met plenty of them... I guess most of them are just doing this for fun. A challenge to the seller, and see what they are going to do.</p>
<h3>This one is showing what really happened inside, is also testing if the app author is telling something right.</h3>
<p>Let me test it and see if it will work</p>
